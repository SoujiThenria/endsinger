Endsinger - Discord bot
=======================
Endsinger is a discord bot written in go. 
You can add channels with a maximum message age in days,
all messages which are older than the specified limit will
be deleted.


Installation
------------
Simply build it with 'go build'.


Running endsinger
-----------------
Endsinger can be run as daemon in the backgroung 
(e.g. as system service) or via the commandline.

Commandline flags are as follow:
Usage of ./endsinger:
  -c string
        The path to the config file. (default "/usr/local/endsinger/endsinger.conf")
  -d    Start the bot as a daemon process.
  -p string
        The path to the pid file. (default "/var/run/endsinger/endsinger.pid")

If the bot is started in daemon mode, the 
pid file will be written. If the process receives
SIGTERM the daemon will exit.
Moreover if the bot is started as daemon the log
will be written via the syslog facility to the daemon log.


Bot commands
------------
The bot supports the following commands:

"/add [channel] [days]"       -> Add a channel to the database. If the 
	command is executed without any optons, the current channel
	with a limit of 5 days will be added to the database.

"/remove [channel]"           -> Removes a channel from the database. 
	Like the /add command, if no channel is specified, the channel
	in which the command was executed will be removed from the database.

"/update [days] [channel]"    -> Update the day limit of an added channel, 
	if no channel is specified the current channel will be used.

"/list"                       -> List all added channels.
